<div class="extra">149. When a man goes to visit his sick Muslim brother, he walks along a path of Paradise until he sits , and when he sits he is cloaked in mercy. If he comes in the morning, seventy thousand angels pray for him until evening, and if he comes in the evening, seventy thousand angels pray for him until morning.</div>

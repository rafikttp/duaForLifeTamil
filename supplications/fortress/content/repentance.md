<div><strong>Reference</strong></div>
<div class="extra">Reference: Muslim 4/2075. Ibn 'Athir explains that the Prophet (SAW) was always vigilant in his remembrance and drawing near to Allah, and if he forgot to do any of what he normally did from time to time, or it slipped his mind, he felt as if he had wronged himself and so he would begin to seek the forgiveness of Allah. See Jami'ul-'Usool 4/386.</div>

An-Nawawi said: This shows that it is Mustahabb (preferred) to face towards the Qiblah when making Du’a, and to raise the hands.

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:
<blockquote>“Your Lord, may He be blessed and exalted, is Kind and Most Generous, and He is too kind to let His slave, if he raises his hands to Him, bring them back empty.” [Abu Dawud].</blockquote>
The palm of the hand should be raised heavenwards, in the manner of a humble beggar who hopes to be given something.

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:
<blockquote>“When you ask of Allah, ask of Him with the palms of your hands, not with the backs of them.” [Abu Dawud].</blockquote>
Should the hands be held together when raising them or should there be a gap between them?

Sheikh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen stated that they should be held together. What he said is: “As for separating them and holding them far apart from one another, there is no basis for that in the Sunnah or in the words of the scholars.” End quote.

Fadalah ibn ‘Ubayd said:
<blockquote>Whilst the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was sitting, a man came in and prayed and said, “O Allah, forgive me and have mercy on me.” The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, “You have been too hasty, O worshipper. When you have prayed and are sitting, praise Allah as He deserves to be praised, and send blessings upon me, then call upon Him.” [At-Tirmidhi]</blockquote>

He encourages that in all things. He is angry with the one who does not ask of Him and He encourages His slaves to ask of Him. Allah says:
<blockquote>“And your Lord said: “Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your (invocation)” [Noble Quran 40:60]</blockquote>
<blockquote>“And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright” [Noble Quran 2:186]</blockquote>

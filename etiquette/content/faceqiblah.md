‘Umar ibn al-Khattab said:
<blockquote>On the day of Badr, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) looked at the Mushrikun, who were one thousand strong, and his companions numbered three hundred and nineteen. Then the Prophet of Allah (peace be upon him) turned to face the Qiblah, then he stretched forth his hands and started to cry out to his Lord: “O Allah, grant me what You have promised me, O Allah, give me what You have promised me. O Allah, if this small band of Muslims perishes, You will not be worshipped on earth.” He kept on crying out to his Lord, stretching forth his hands, facing towards the Qiblah, until his cloak fell from his shoulders.
